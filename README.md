# LazyChain

**LazyChain** is a terminal-based user interface (TUI) that lets you interact with the [Algorand blockchain](https://www.algorand.com/) directly from your terminal.

Built with [BubbleTea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea) and the official [Algorand Go SDK](https://github.com/algorand/go-algorand-sdk), LazyChain makes exploring accounts, transactions, applications, and network status fast and intuitive — no browser required.
